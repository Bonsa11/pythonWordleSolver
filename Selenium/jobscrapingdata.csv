ANALYST GRADUATE PROGRAMME,OCADO GROUP,HATFIELD,https://www.indeed.co.uk/rc/clk?jk=b6b68b7616a8e958&fccid=dde460449ad6f8d7&vjs=3,3.0,None,"analytics graduate programme
do you want to apply insight and analytics to commercial problems to provide actionable recommendations? can you explain complex problems in a simple and clear way? do you have an inquisitive mind to explore and improve projects using a breadth of research and customer data?
the ocado analytics graduate scheme consists of four six month placements in different teams across our business, these include:
supply chain: this team encompasses the logistical elements of our business: the people who forecast our product sales, determine the quantity and timing of our orders with suppliers, and ensure that our full product range is available whenever customers choose to place their order. as a supply chain analyst you will be collaborating with senior stakeholders, helping to deliver success by using a variety of data analysis tools to interrogate and analyse big data, providing key insights to enhance customer experience whilst minimising risks to the operation. recent projects involve supporting the roll out of ocado's new same day delivery service 'zoom' and working in partnership with our exciting new partnership with m&s.
business planning: this team is at the heart of our highly efficient distribution network. they ensure we have the right resources, in the right place, driving the right routes to deliver over 400,000 orders a week on time.
business planning analysts help to implement business planning objectives by connecting operational processes and trials to metric performance (for example, designing and measuring the impact of a trial of a new routing profile on our delivery efficiency), and using this to influence businesses capacity and cost plans for the future.
fulfilment operations: unlike old fashioned supermarkets that depend on a network of superstores, we operate massive customer fulfilment centers (cfcs) using ocado's pioneering technology platform, to fulfil customer orders. we process millions of grocery items through our cfcs every day for delivery to ocado's and morrisons' customers.
the operational excellence analysts help to continuously improve our operational performance by providing and reviewing key performance indicators for our cfc operations.
data science: the data science team is responsible for developing machine learning solutions and solving optimisation problems across ocado's business - from recommending products to customers, to demand forecasting and route optimisation.
data science analysts work alongside product analysts across multiple projects to help to define and monitor key product metrics (e.g. assessing data quality in projects such as 'instant order' which helps ocado customers by placing regularly bought items into their basket automatically), design and evaluate test experiments for new developed features and collaborate with cross functional stakeholders to identify new opportunities.
by the end of the ocado analytics graduate scheme, you will have developed exceptional analytical and problem solving skills, with the ability to fully understand a problem, design a suitable methodology to address it and apply effective analysis techniques on large datasets to make actionable recommendations. consequently you will establish computer programme fluency in sql, python and tableau and a good understanding of statistical methods. you will develop excellent communication skills, articulating clear insights into complex data to key stakeholders with ease. the responsibility and autonomy given from day one will ensure that you fully embrace personal accountability, proactively leading and managing your own projects to help solve key business problems.
the skills acquired in ocado group's fast paced environment and your knowledge of how the business operates will put you in an excellent position to obtain a permanent role at the end of the graduate scheme in the business area of your choice.
we are innovators, we are creators and we are problem solvers. we are ocado group grads, are you?
